# Online Retail II EDA (Project 1)

This project delivers an end-to-end exploratory data analysis of the UCI **Online Retail II** dataset (transaction-level e-commerce data, 2009–2011). The goal is to demonstrate practical data cleaning, defensible revenue definitions, and insight-driven analysis across time, products, customers, geography, and returns.

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository — [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii)
- **Files:** Place the CSV or Excel file in `data/` (the notebook loads the first available file).

## Key Questions
- How clean is the dataset (missingness, returns, anomalies, duplicates)?
- How does revenue evolve over time and by weekday/hour?
- Which products and customers drive revenue (and returns)?
- What patterns differ by geography (UK vs non-UK)?

## Key Findings (from notebook)
- Revenue and invoices show clear seasonality with identifiable peaks.
- Weekday and business-hour orders dominate revenue.
- Order values are right-skewed with a long tail.
- A small set of products contributes a large share of revenue.
- Customer revenue is highly concentrated (Pareto-like).
- Returns are concentrated in a small subset of products and customers.

## How to Run
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Add the dataset file (`.csv`, `.xlsx`, or `.xls`) to `data/`.
3. Run the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebooks/eda_online_retail_ii.ipynb
   ```

## Data Cleaning Decisions (Summary)
- Standardized column names to snake_case and trimmed whitespace in key text fields.
- Parsed `invoice_date`, dropping invalid rows.
- Removed exact duplicate rows.
- Removed rows where `unit_price <= 0`.
- Kept missing `customer_id` rows for non-customer analyses; excluded them only in customer-level sections.
- Identified returns via negative quantities and invoices starting with “C”; reported both gross and net revenue.

## Selected Plots
These plots are generated by the notebook and saved to `images/`.
